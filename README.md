## Future ##

I plan on implementing profile pages for each user, allowing them to see all of their postings. The next step would be to 
add AWS S3 for photo uploads to avoid having to use image URLs and hosting. Along with both of those features, adding bookings
will be my third added feature. This is a constantly evolving process that I will be working on daily.
